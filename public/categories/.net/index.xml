      <description>I have been watching Mix11 videos about asp.net mvc3 and felt pretty excited to mingle with these latest bits but I didn&amp;rsquo;t wanted to limit myself to local environment I wanted to know what efforts are required if I am developing with latest stuff one limitation I had that my host always take ages to update server so I had support for .net3.5. I email them about this thing and in reply they told me either wait 6 months or pay $8.</description>

      <description>I have been clearing my concepts regarding inheritance and investigating if parent reference variable can point to child class object and vice versa.

      <description>Hello guys,
This is my first Bll class that is using linq and returning objects to presentation layer. Main data component class is ItemsDT which contain another skeleton class &amp;ldquo;ItemGridView&amp;rdquo; for custom view of items data table. &amp;ldquo;ItemGridView&amp;rdquo; contains basically have the fields that i want to show in my presentation layer. Note that items datatable has many column which can be reterived by calling AllItems() method.
If you just want to list all the methods into your table that is also included into your linq to sql file then you can set your method return type to list collection of the type that specified in dbml file (linq to sql).</description>

      <title>C# Interfaces</title>

      <description>These parts are taken from msdn and some might be taken from other websites.
An interface can inherit from one or more base interfaces.
When a base type list contains a base class and interfaces, the base class must come first in the list.
A class that implements an interface can explicitly implement members of that interface. An explicitly implemented member cannot be accessed through a class instance, but only through an instance of the interface.</description>

      <description>hi guys,
Well I like to share one more experiment with you that is how to call a webservice from your javascript(jquery). For that again you need to have an asp.net ajax enable website.
Lets first examine what are the requiments for webservice if we need to call it from javascript well after having asp.net ajax enable website first is you should mark your serverice as [ScriptService] what it does it will make all the methods/functions of your webservice to be accessable from javascript code and it also serialise your webservice response using JASON .</description>

      <description>I was reading how to write events for your custom classes so after reading a little I thought give it a shot and created this sample code. Below code is using Product class with event and delegate for event handling and other class named Test is using this class and manipulate product class data. If you change the Name of the product event will fire.

      <description>Hi Guys,
I am reading more on design patterns from this article after little theory session here is working code. Key point was all of the collection classes in the System.Collections namespace, as well as arrays, implement IEnumerable and can therefore be iterated over.

      <description>Hi folks,
Well I am investigating design patterns by reading an article so after reading a bit I thought it would be nice if I write some code and test it.

      <description>hi guyz
Sorry for writing after such a long time i guess i am very busy now a days so for a project i needed to read my smtp email settings defined in my web.config file so after some efforts i am able to read these settings direct from my system .net section.
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 System.Configuration.Configuration config = System.Web.Configuration.WebConfigurationManager.OpenWebConfiguration(HttpContext.Current.Request.ApplicationPath); System.Net.Configuration.MailSettingsSectionGroup settings = (System.Net.Configuration.MailSettingsSectionGroup) config.GetSectionGroup(&amp;#34;system.net/mailSettings&amp;#34;); Response.Write(&amp;#34;&amp;amp;lt;br&amp;amp;gt;Username=&amp;#34;+settings.Smtp.Network.UserName); Response.</description>

      <description>If you want to know only the directory name not the full path of the page that is currently displaying you can use this code
1 2 3 4 string sPath = System.Web.HttpContext.Current.Request.Url.AbsolutePath; System.IO.FileInfo oInfo = new System.IO.FileInfo(sPath); string sRet = oInfo.Directory.Name.ToString(); Response.Write(&amp;#34;&amp;amp;lt;br&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;lt;br&amp;amp;gt;Directory name===&amp;#34; + sRet + &amp;#34;&amp;amp;lt;br&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;lt;br&amp;amp;gt;&amp;#34;); Happy Coding

      <title>How to get pagename of itself</title>

      <description>If you want to display the filename or page name of the current displaying page just use these two lines and it will show only the filename like default.aspx, najam.aspx or indexas.aspx no matter it these pages are located deep into your site structure.
1 string pagename = System.IO.Path.GetFileName(Request.ServerVariables[&amp;#34;SCRIPT_NAME&amp;#34;]); Response.Write(pagename); Enjoy coding
