      <description>I have been involved with development of small and large web applications for quite sometime now. While using latest tools and technology for development I always felt my workflow is from ancient times. Recently I got much obsessed with automation, I thought to improve my development workflow. In my mind I knew I need to do something about build process, tests the build, deployment of latest build and notify team members that new code/build is available.</description>

      <description>I am very much into learning new tools and burning hours of my life trying to figure them out. To track whats new on development horizon and technology I tend to keep my eyes on sessions, conferences, blogs and screen-casts.
In past few days I wanted to explore no-sql options two in particular RavenDB and MongoDB. I have successfully completed the environment setup for raven but didn&amp;rsquo;t use it in any project until now.</description>

      <description>Few weeks back I came across a page that has multiple jquery versions referenced in it and I had no idea which jquery version is actually running. So after little bit of googling I find following solution.
//Returns &amp;ldquo;1.3.1&amp;rdquo; jQuery.fn.jquery;</description>

      <description>Hi guyz,
Today I am sharing how to call asp.net web page code behind methods from client side javascript in my case it will be jquery.
Let us divide this into two parts the server side and client side on server side we have to write a function or page method.
1 2 3 4 5 [WebMethod] public static string AddStrings(string a, string b) { return string.Format(&amp;#34;my friend answer is {0}&amp;#34;, a + b); } Note that we mark our AddStrings function as WebMethod and its public and static this is the basic requirement for the funtion if you want to call it from javascript or jquery.</description>
