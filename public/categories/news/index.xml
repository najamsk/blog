      <description>I have been watching Mix11 videos about asp.net mvc3 and felt pretty excited to mingle with these latest bits but I didn&amp;rsquo;t wanted to limit myself to local environment I wanted to know what efforts are required if I am developing with latest stuff one limitation I had that my host always take ages to update server so I had support for .net3.5. I email them about this thing and in reply they told me either wait 6 months or pay $8.</description>

      <description>Hi guyz,
After many days I am back and back for good :) recentlly i purchased a domain name and hosting package, so that i can have my own website and I want my settings persistent which was not possible in the case of free hosting like in my case my hosting provider remove the mysql database support.
Can&amp;rsquo;t tell you how happy I am after getting my website up and running its currently in beta state I will design it from scratch as time permits and planning to use table less design.</description>
