      <description>I have heard about Minecraft before and never paid much attention to it until my wife told me to try it out and see if our kid take any interest in that. I took this mission and invest bit of time, if I recall correctly it took me 4 days to get the result i wanted with mods. I had to do mods to get Elephants available my Kid loves them.</description>

      <description>NOTE: The package manager in Suse 10.2 appears to be working a lot better than the one in 10.1, so this time we will be using YAST and not SMART to install the required packages.
The first step in resolving the multimedia issue is to setup additional YAST software sources. The software repositories used in this howto, are Packman and Guru. If possible, please use a mirror instead of the main download site to prevent overloading one download location.</description>
