      <description>I am managing different servers and each of them have different responsibilities.
I am learning powershell and trying to build lego blocks that will eventually become recipes for automating tasks on different servers. One important block is email report for that if you don&amp;rsquo;t have smtp configured on server you can use following powershell script with gmail SMTP information.
I will open source on github many of the small powershell scripts that you can make use of to build something cool.</description>
