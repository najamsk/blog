      <title>Vim Usage</title>

      <description>ctrl+o and ctrl+shit+i is the combo for going back and forth using vim jumps. Normally it should be ctrl+i or tab to jump forward. If it&amp;rsquo;s not working then I found you can use ctrl+shift+i.
Will keep updating this post with other vim related things that i want to track and share.
Golang Import Error Sometimes if you install golang package using go get in terminal outside vim editor. It&amp;rsquo;s still showing import error.</description>

      <description>Following will convert golang struct to a 99design graphql schema type.
1 2 3 4 5 6 type Post struct { UserID int `json:&amp;#34;userId&amp;#34;` ID int `json:&amp;#34;id&amp;#34;` Title string `json:&amp;#34;title&amp;#34;` Body string `json:&amp;#34;body&amp;#34;` } If you want to change case on selected lines you can use following.
1 :3,6s/`.*/ Above regular expression will remove the json tags from the line 3 to 6.
1 2 3 4 5 6 type Post struct { UserID int ID int Title string Body string } Next two steps are field name to camel case and data type to be capitalize.</description>

      <description>As I&amp;rsquo;m working on refactoring some legacy code, I&amp;rsquo;ve encountered the challenge of changing the variable naming convention. The current convention is not standardized, and I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed that snake case (e.g., first_name) is commonly used. One additional constraint is to only change part of a file.
Following will looks for any places with an underscore followed by a lower case letter and replaces that with an upper case letter.
1 :1,$s/_\([a-z]\)/\u\1/g If you want to change case on selected lines you can use following.</description>

      <description>Sometimes, I tend to forget this simple command, which can be handy for quickly switching to the directory of the current buffer in Vim. This can be useful when searching for files within your project, especially if your project search is not based on the git root or if your current directory is not being tracked by git.

      <description>I am playing with Hugo trying to get a blog up and running with it. I have following TODO items in mind with my blog:
get a clean theme get code preview maybe comments support something? deployment of theme and any custom code with Vercel formerly known as Zeit. Get Theme I end up choosing hyde-hyde due to it&amp;rsquo;s slick clean look. After that I explore how to make sidebar links work.</description>

      <description>When your web application is running on web server and you don&amp;rsquo;t have automatic backup service available form your hosting service provider taking manual backups is really a frustrating job.
I have Pscx module installed on my PC and they have a nice little command Write-Zip available so I decided to write a custom powershell function that can create archive in zip formats for me. You can use windows task scheduler to invoke any powershell script so you can take advantage of this to have automatic daily or monthly backups.</description>

      <description>In my last post I have shared hwo you can archive a folder via powershell and Pscx. In my normal backup process I am used to upload zip files using ftp client like filezilla but now I am trying powershell to perform this task.
Please feel free to test following code and let me know your thoughts and improvements.

      <description>I have been involved with development of small and large web applications for quite sometime now. While using latest tools and technology for development I always felt my workflow is from ancient times. Recently I got much obsessed with automation, I thought to improve my development workflow. In my mind I knew I need to do something about build process, tests the build, deployment of latest build and notify team members that new code/build is available.</description>

      <description>I am managing different servers and each of them have different responsibilities.
I am learning powershell and trying to build lego blocks that will eventually become recipes for automating tasks on different servers. One important block is email report for that if you don&amp;rsquo;t have smtp configured on server you can use following powershell script with gmail SMTP information.
I will open source on github many of the small powershell scripts that you can make use of to build something cool.</description>

      <description>I needed to genrate an email log that contains every email from our clients these normally stored in their seprate folder. One way was to copy and paste email headers and body into a word document. Second was to use powershell and got all the emails using some script.
After playing a little with powershell and google few of its basic I have completed my task with powershell.

      <description>I read this articleÂ http://bit.ly/16pqBm and find out the power of overflow that is when you set it to a value it creates a new block formatting context in simple word that means non floated elementâ€™s content will not flowÂ aroundÂ the floated element instead will get narrower.
PS. Width should not be mentioned for non floated content so it can get narrower.</description>

      <description>Hello guys,
This is my first Bll class that is using linq and returning objects to presentation layer. Main data component class is ItemsDT which contain another skeleton class &amp;ldquo;ItemGridView&amp;rdquo; for custom view of items data table. &amp;ldquo;ItemGridView&amp;rdquo; contains basically have the fields that i want to show in my presentation layer. Note that items datatable has many column which can be reterived by calling AllItems() method.
If you just want to list all the methods into your table that is also included into your linq to sql file then you can set your method return type to list collection of the type that specified in dbml file (linq to sql).</description>

When a base type list contains a base class and interfaces, the base class must come first in the list.
A class that implements an interface can explicitly implement members of that interface. An explicitly implemented member cannot be accessed through a class instance, but only through an instance of the interface.</description>

      <description>Hi guyz,
Today I am sharing how to call asp.net web page code behind methods from client side javascript in my case it will be jquery.
Let us divide this into two parts the server side and client side on server side we have to write a function or page method.
1 2 3 4 5 [WebMethod] public static string AddStrings(string a, string b) { return string.Format(&amp;#34;my friend answer is {0}&amp;#34;, a + b); } Note that we mark our AddStrings function as WebMethod and its public and static this is the basic requirement for the funtion if you want to call it from javascript or jquery.</description>

      <description>hi guys,
Well I like to share one more experiment with you that is how to call a webservice from your javascript(jquery). For that again you need to have an asp.net ajax enable website.
Lets first examine what are the requiments for webservice if we need to call it from javascript well after having asp.net ajax enable website first is you should mark your serverice as [ScriptService] what it does it will make all the methods/functions of your webservice to be accessable from javascript code and it also serialise your webservice response using JASON .</description>

      <description>I was reading how to write events for your custom classes so after reading a little I thought give it a shot and created this sample code. Below code is using Product class with event and delegate for event handling and other class named Test is using this class and manipulate product class data. If you change the Name of the product event will fire.

      <description>List the remote branches that exist for a repository you have cloned:
git remote show origin Create a local branch that tracks one of the remote branches and then use that local branch:
git checkout --track -b name_of_local_branch origin/name_of_remote_branch If you have not done a pull since someone else created the remote branch, you may first need to do:
git fetch Remove branch from repo.
git push {repo} :heads/{branch}
Ex: git push origin :somebranch removes somebranch</description>

      <description>NOTE: The package manager in Suse 10.2 appears to be working a lot better than the one in 10.1, so this time we will be using YAST and not SMART to install the required packages.
The first step in resolving the multimedia issue is to setup additional YAST software sources. The software repositories used in this howto, are Packman and Guru. If possible, please use a mirror instead of the main download site to prevent overloading one download location.</description>

1 string pagename = System.IO.Path.GetFileName(Request.ServerVariables[&amp;#34;SCRIPT_NAME&amp;#34;]); Response.Write(pagename); Enjoy coding
