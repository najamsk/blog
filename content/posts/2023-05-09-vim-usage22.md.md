ctrl+0 and ctrl+shit+i is the combo for going back and forth using vim jumps. Normally it should be ctrl+i or tab to jump forward. If it's not working then I found you can use ctrl+shift+i.

Will keep updating this post with other vim related things that i want to track and share.

Thanks for reading.
