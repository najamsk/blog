ctrl+0 and ctrl+shit+i is the combo for going back and forth using vim jumps. Normally it should be ctrl+i or tab to jump forward. If it's not working then I found you can use ctrl+shift+i.

Will keep updating this post with other vim related things that i want to track and share.

### Golang

Sometimes if you install golang package using go get in terminal outside vim editor. It's still showing import error. Until its fixed by gopls or
whatever plugin is handling that you can just kill the goplz process.

{{\< highlight golang  "linenos=true, style=emacs">}}

pkill gopls

{{\< / highlight >}}

Killing gopls will let neovim/vim to get rid of this false import erorr.

Thanks for reading.
